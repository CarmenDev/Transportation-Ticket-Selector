# Transportation Ticket Selector

This React web app helps tourists choose the right BVG tickets in Berlin according to the number of visitors, their age, the number of days they will spend there, and whether they're bringing a bike along or not.

The app's structure relies on the react-decision-tree-flow and was deployed with Firebase. Please click on the link to run it.
